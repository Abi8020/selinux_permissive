# SELinux Permissive

This module switches SELinux to permissive mode during boot process.

This module intentionally lowers security settings of your
phone. Please, don't use it if you don't know what you are doing.

The module will not work if your kernel compiled with always enforcing config,
e.g., stock samsung kernels.
